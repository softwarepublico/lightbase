 * class ALArchiveBase
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This is the most important class definition in the library.
 * ALArchiveBase defines the interface to archive objects, on disk,
 * memory, or whatever.  This class is a pure base class, so you
 * won't ever create an instance of an ALArchiveBase object.
 *
 * The derived class for a given archive type has several very important
 * virtual functions it has to provide.  The most important two are
 * CreateCompressionEngine() and CreateStorageObject().  These
 * two functions are called when the directory is being read from 
 * a given archive.  In the directory, the type of a storage object
 * and the compression engine used to create it are defined as just
 * plain integers.  Somewhere, somebody has to look at these integers
 * and create real objects based on their contents, and then maybe
 * perform some initialization as well.
 *
 * At first glance it might seem like there is no reason the base class
 * shouldn't just do all this work itself.  However, there is a good reason
 * not to do it this way.  If the base class is designed to be a completely
 * general purpose class, it would need to know how to create a Greenleaf
 * compression engine, a Microsoft compression engine, and so on.  It
 * would also need to know how to create all different kinds of storage
 * objects, probably including our demo storage objects.  This would mean
 * that the base ALArchiveBase class would basically have to link in our
 * entire library.  What is worse, if someone created a lean and mean
 * derived class that only supported one storage type and one compression
 * engine, they would still have to link in all that other code because
 * it was referenced in the base class.
 *
 * So the compromise is the current hierarchy.  We have a base class that
 * has no links to any engines or storage objects.  A user can derive
 * a lean and mean class from the base class and not have to worry as much
 * about code bloat.  On the other hand, we have a relatively full
 * featured derived class one level down, called ALArchive.  It
 * has the built in links to the "ordinary" object types.  This way, you
 * have a ready-built class that will do lots of ordinary jobs without a
 * lot of fuss.
 *
 * DATA MEMBERS
 *
 *  mpArchiveStorageObject   : Pointer to the Archive's storage object.
 *                             This is the ALFile, or whatever, that
 *                             actually contains (or will contain) the
 *                             archive.
 *
 *  mszComment               : The comment associated with this archive.
 *                             This comment is stored on disk along with
 *                             the archive directory.
 *
 *  mlDirectoryOffset        : The offset in the storage object to the
 *                             archive's directory.  All of the compressed
 *                             objects in the archive are stored sequentially
 *                             at the start of the file.  The directory
 *                             and other information starts after all of
 *                             the objects.  This data member tells us
 *                             how to get there.  Not filled in until
 *                             an archive has actually been created.
 *
 *  miVersion                : The archive version.  This version field
 *                             refers to the format version of the archive,
 *                             which won't necessarily be the save as 
 *                             the format of ArchiveLib.
 *
 *  miDeleteStorageObject    : If this flag is set, the storage object
 *                             associated with the archive object will
 *                             have its object destroyed in the 
 *                             archive destructor.  This saves you
 *                             from having to do the job explicitly
 *                             in your code.
 *
 *  mStatus                  : The only public data member, this is a
 *                             standard ArchiveLib status object.
 *
 *
 * MEMBER FUNCTIONS
 *
 *  ALArchiveBase()              : The only constructor.
 *  ~ALArchiveBase()             : The virtual destructor.
 *  operator new()               : Memory allocation operator used when
 *                                 the library is in a DLL
 *  AddJobs()                    : Protected function used to create
 *  CopyJobs()                   : Protected function used to create
 *  AddDirectoryEntries()        : Protected function used to create, append
 *  CalculateJobSize()           : Protected function to help monitor 
 *  CalculateCompressedJobSize() : Protected function to help monitor
 *  ScanStatus()                 : Protected function to update status
 *  CreateCompressionEngine()    : Virtual fn used when extracting
 *  CreateStorageObject()        : Virtual fn used when extracting
 *  WriteArchiveData()           : Protected fn to write part of directory
 *  ReadArchiveData()            : Protected fn to read part of directory
 *  Create(ALEntryList&)         : Create a new archive
 *  Create(ALArchiveBase&,       : Create a new archive from another
 *         ALEntryList&)
 *  Append(ALEntryList&)         : Add objects to archive
 *  Append(ALArchiveBase&,       : Add objects to archive from another one
 *         ALEntryList&)
 *  Extract()                    : Extract objects from an archive
 *  Delete()                     : Delete objects from an archive
 *  GetComment()                 : Get the comment stored in the archive
 *  SetComment()                 : Set the comment that will be stored
 *  ReadDirectory()              : Read the directory into an ALEntryList
