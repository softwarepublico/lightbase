/*
 * class ALMemory : public ALStorage 
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *  Class ALMemory is an ALStorage class that stores its data in memory
 *  buffers. Under real mode MS-DOS, buffers are limited to 64Kbytes.
 *  Under Windows, they can get a lot bigger.  There are slight
 *  differences in operations between the the Windows and MS-DOS 
 *  versions, so you will see some #ifdefs here and there.
 *
 *  You can use ALMemory to work with a buffer of your own, or you
 *  can ask the class to allocate the memory for you.  You can
 *  also change the ownership of the buffer in midstream, allowing
 *  you to take control of a buffer that the class has generated.
 *
 * DATA MEMBERS
 *
 *  mfUserOwnsBuffer    : If this flag is set, it indicates that the user
 *                        owns the buffer, not the class.  This means
 *                        the class can't grow the buffer if it runs out
 *                        of space, and it can't delete it in the 
 *                        ALMemory destructor.
 *                      
 *  mhUserMemoryHandle  : Under Windows, this member contains the handle
 *                        of the Windows memory block that has been
 *                        allocated
 *
 *  muUserBufferSize    : The actual size of the buffer, whether it is
 *                        owned by the user or not.  This is a size_t
 *                        member under real mode DOS, and a long under
 *                        Windows.
 *
 *  mpcUserBuffer       : A pointer to the buffer the class is presently
 *                        using.  The name User Buffer was probably a bad
 *                        choice, because this is the pointer we use 
 *                        regardless of whether or not the user owns the
 *                        buffer.
 *
 * MEMBER FUNCTIONS
 *
 *  ALMemory()        : The constructor, slightly different between DOS 
 *                      and Windows.
 *  ~ALMemory()       : The virtual destructor.
 *  operator new()    : Memory allocation operator, only used when the
 *                      library is in a DLL.  Note that this isn't the
 *                      operator used to allocate the buffer, just the
 *                      one to allocate a class object.
 *  Open()            : Open the storage object for reading and writing.
 *  Create()          : Create a new buffer to write to.
 *  Close()           : Close the existing memory object.
 *  LoadBuffer()      : Load a new block from the memory object into
 *                      the I/O buffer.
 *  FlushBuffer()     : Flush the contents of the I/O buffer, sending
 *                      the contents into the memory object.
 *  Seek()            : Seek to a new location in the memory object.
 *  Rename()          : Give the object a new name.  Names are pretty
 *                      irrelevant for memory objects, feel free to use
 *                      whatever you want here.
 *  UnRename()        : Restore the old name.
 *  Delete()          : Delete the memory object.  It is gone forever.
 *  RenameToBackup()  : Give the memory object an arbitrary new name.
 *  GrowUserBuffer()  : A private function used to give us more space
 *                      when the memory object is owner of the buffer.
 *
 * REVISION HISTORY
 *
 *  May 26, 1994  1.0A  : First release
