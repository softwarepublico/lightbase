 * class ALOpenInputFile 
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *  This is a utility class.  The constructor opens a file for input,
 *  and keeps track of whether it was already open or not.  The destructor
 *  will automatically close the file if it was closed when the 
 *  ctor was invoked.
 *
 * DATA MEMBERS
 *
 * miFileWasOpen   : The flag that keeps track of the file's state
 *                   at the start of the routine.
 *
 * mpFile          : A pointer to the file, so we can close it in the dtor.
 *
 * MEMBER FUNCTIONS
 *
 *  ALOpenInputFile   : The constructor, opens the file.
 *  ~ALOpenInputFile  : The destructor, can close the file.
 *  operator new      : This operator is used in the Win16 
 *                      DLL version of ArchiveLib.
 *
 * REVISION HISTORY
 *
 *  May 26, 1994  1.0A  : First release

 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *  This is a utility class.  The constructor opens the first file for

 *
 * DATA MEMBERS
 *
 *  mInputFile     : The input file open object.  It does all the work
 *                   related to the input file.
 *
 *  mOutputFile    : The output file open object.  It does all the work
 *                   related to the output file.
 *
 * MEMBER FUNCTIONS
 *
 *  ALOpenFiles   : The constructor, opens both files.
 *
 *  ~ALOpenFiles  : The destructor, can close one or both files.
 *
 *  operator new  : This operator is used in the Win16 
 *                  DLL version of ArchiveLib.
